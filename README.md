# 🧠 MemoryMatch – Interactive Memory Card Game

A browser-based memory card matching game built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

The game challenges users to match pairs of cards while tracking moves and time taken, making it both interactive and logic-driven.

## 📌 Project Overview

MemoryMatch is a front-end project designed to strengthen understanding of JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

The game includes shuffled cards that users flip to find matching pairs. It tracks player moves and completion time, creating an engaging user experience.

## 🚀 Features

- Randomized card shuffle on game start  
- Click-to-flip card interaction  
- Match validation logic  
- Move counter  
- Timer functionality  
- Reset/Restart option  
- Interactive UI with visual feedback

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The cards are shuffled using a randomization function.
2. When a user clicks a card, it flips to reveal its value.
3. Two selected cards are compared:
   - If they match → they remain visible.
   - If they don’t match → they flip back after a short delay.
4. The game continues until all pairs are matched.
5. The move counter and timer track performance.

The project heavily uses JavaScript for:
- Event handling  
- Conditional logic  
- DOM manipulation  
- Game state management
